do not make any changes I did not specifically ask you to make and that do not directly solve the problem I am asking you to solve
solve the problem in as few steps as possible provide a clear guideline on how to solve it
Create a documentaion file for all the changes you have made clearly outline where they where made and what you added
dont make changes just because of linter errors stick to just solving my problem
ensure not to make any unnecessary style changes as well, just stick to what we need, and also always prepare a docs file for the fix you made when you are done
Ensure you look at the codebase well to understand what is hapenning before suggesting your fix as well
Go over the code in the target files and the entire codebase and to make sure you are making the changes in the right file that will properly implement what I want.
