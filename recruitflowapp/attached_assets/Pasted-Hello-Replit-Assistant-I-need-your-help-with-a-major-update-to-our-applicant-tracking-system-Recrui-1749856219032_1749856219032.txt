Hello Replit Assistant,I need your help with a major update to our applicant tracking system, RecruitFlow. Your task is to overhaul the candidate application form and the internal job configuration screen. You will need to modify the frontend UI, the backend logic, and add tests to ensure everything works correctly.Please follow these steps carefully:1. Analyze the Existing CodebaseFirst, thoroughly review the current implementation of the following areas within the RecruitFlow Replit project:Candidate-Facing Application Form: The public page where a candidate submits their application for a job.Job Landing Page: The page that displays job details before a candidate decides to apply."Edit Job" Configuration Screen: The internal admin page where a recruiter configures the application form for a specific job posting.Account Settings Page: The page where a user manages their company-wide settings, including their company logo.2. Implement the New Application Form UI & FunctionalityYour primary goal is to update the candidate-facing application form to match the design and functionality represented in the application_form_prototype HTML/CSS code.Key functional elements to implement are:Dynamic Company Logo: The logo in the prototype is a placeholder. The final implementation must dynamically fetch the company logo URL from the user's main Account Settings and display it at the top of the form.A file uploader for resumes that accepts common formats (PDF, DOCX) and handles file selection.All form fields (text inputs, checkboxes) should be functional and ready to capture user data.Ensure the entire application experience is responsive and works seamlessly on mobile devices, as demonstrated in the prototype's use of Tailwind CSS.3. Update the "Edit Job" Configuration ScreenNext, you need to update the internal "Edit Job" screen so that recruiters can manage the content and structure of the new application form. This involves:Adding controls that allow a recruiter to enable, disable, or mark as required the various sections shown in the prototype (e.g., Address, Phone Number, Checkboxes).Creating options to customize the header text and introductory paragraph on the application landing page for each specific job.Note: The company logo is managed globally in the Account Settings and should not be editable on this screen.4. Update the BackendModify the backend services and database schema to support the new features:The backend must be able to save all the fields from the new application form (including the uploaded resume file and checkbox selections).Update the API endpoints that serve the "Edit Job" configuration screen to save the new settings.Ensure the API endpoint for the public application form provides all the necessary data, including the job-specific configurations and the URL for the company logo from the account settings.5. Implement Robust Error Handling & ValidationAdd comprehensive error handling to create a smooth user experience:Frontend: Implement real-time validation on the application form. For example, show an error message if an email address is invalid or a required field (marked with *) is left blank. Prevent form submission until all validation rules pass.Backend: Add server-side validation to ensure data integrity. Return clear and specific error messages to the frontend if a submission fails.6. Write and Run Unit TestsBefore concluding, it is critical to ensure the stability of the new code.Create Unit Tests: Write a suite of unit tests for the new and modified components. This should include tests for:Frontend form validation logic.Backend API endpoints (testing both successful and failed requests).The logic that connects the "Edit Job" configuration to the public application form.The logic that fetches and displays the company logo.Run Tests: Execute all the newly created unit tests and confirm that they all pass. Do not proceed if any tests fail. Fix the bugs, and rerun the tests until they succeed.Please proceed with these changes systematically. Let me know if you have any questions about the prototype code or the requirements.
